# Analogical Observatory: A Combinatorial Semantic Trees Visualization with Analogical Deduction

Developer: Yilin(Harry) Lu

## Introduction

A visualization system that visualizes semantic trees/graphs with given word combinations by TypeScript, ReactFlow, and D3.js. Implemented a constrained optimization algorithm for semantic tree construction, and an NLP pipeline to generate word embeddings with different NLP algorithms such as transformers, BERT, and Gensim.
